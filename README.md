What this repository is for
---------------------------

As controlled documentation PRs should not be issued against the Master repository. Please use Develop.

---------------------------

Recommendations
---------------
It is recommended that documents in this repository consist of pure Unicode text, such as HTML or Markdown, so that these files can be used in other websites without significant modification.

If you are website or other content developer that has use for this content, then we suggest that you clone this repository (or a specific, applicable commit) and pull the source of your document from it. For example your CMS, static builder, or live server could access the relevant file in your local repository ensure that itâ€™s up to date and minimizing errors due to change control.


Temporary Master Branch During Launch
-------------------------------------
Notwithstanding the requirement above for Master/Develop use for controlled and reference-only documentation, PRs may be issued against Master as long as the Master file is prefixed with `# DRAFT # DRAFT # DRAFT` on the first line. This offers the highest chance of document visibility until HTACG members have voted to finalize a document.
