HTACG Chair Succession Plan
===========================

Any person holding the office of Chair holds considerable control over assets
owned by HTACG, and as such it is in the interest of HTACG to ensure an orderly
leadership transition so that the mission of HTACG can proceed uninterrupted.


Determining Chairs
------------------

The HTACG community shall determine the person or persons who will, upon
accepting the role, fill the role of HTACG Chair. 

The mechanism for determining who fills the role of Chair shall be in accordance
with the [HTACG W3C Group Page][1] using the tools provided. In the event of
technical difficulties or non-availability of the system, concensus shall be
reached among members on the [internal-htacg@w3.org][2].

The Chair shall agree to step down upon a decision from the Community Group.


Assets the Chairs May Control
-----------------------------

Certain assets may be in direct control of the Chair. In the event of a
transition the outgoing chair agrees to release these assets to the incoming
Chair or to an escrow organization as directed by the incoming Chair.

If an expense shall be incurred during this transfer a good faith effort by the
outgoing and incoming Chair to minimize the expense shall be made. Payment of
costs shall be left to the good judgment and wisdom of the HTACG members.

Examples of assets that the Chair may control include but are not limited to the
