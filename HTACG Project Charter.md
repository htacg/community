HTML Tidy Advocacy Community Group (HTACG) Charter
==================================================

The mission of the Tidy Advocacy Group (“HTACG”) is to continue the evolution of **HTML Tidy** by offering continued support, development, and evolution of the **HTML Tidy** command line application and library.

2. Scope
--------

This Group will maintain and produce incremental versions of **HTML Tidy** that retain its capabilities for legacy (X)HTML while adding features and operability with current released- and mature-RFC versions of W3C (X)HTML and (X)HTML-related documents.

Recognizing the influence of other W3C Community Groups and modern trends that have the potential to develop faster than released- and mature-RFC versions of documents, this Group will monitor developments in the field for possible integration into **HTML Tidy**.

The Group may hold meetings and other events as required to fulfill its mission.

### 2.1 Success Criteria

This Community Group’s work will be considered a success if it accomplishes two distinct objectives:

1. Provide the infrastructure for a stable group of developers, users, and implementors to request, provide, test, and release changes, bug fixes and feature enhancements to **HTML Tidy** in an environment that welcomes collaborative efforts and that is flexible to fluidity in the composition of the HTACG membership, as measured by:

    - Maintaining occupied the post of Chair of HTACG, being democratically elected by members of the Community Group.

    - The publication of a succession plan that ensures that the HTACG Chair has access to all of the infrastructure organized by HTACG, including but not limited to W3C and other repositories, websites, and other HTACG interests and properties.

    - The publication of a roadmap at least one major version ahead of current stable. The roadmap must also include a statement detailing the application of a semantic numbering scheme.

    - The publication of a formal pull request policy detailing requirements for accepting pull requests and the circumstances that will allow for their acceptance.

    - The publication of a contributor agreement to ensure that contributions do not pollute the code with incompatible licenses.

    - The publication of standard developer documentation indicating how to perform the multiple required tests prior to submitting a PR.

    - Consistent and professional branding including presence, documentation, and formal communications when such should be necessary.
    
    - Recognition as the **HTML Tidy** Advocacy Group as measured by inclusion in multiple standard package services.

2. That there exist machine-compilable source code publicly available that:

    - Is capable of building and installing using distribution build scripts on multiple operating system including (but not limited too) released versions of Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

    - When built produces a C library and command line executable capable of passing all current and future test cases per the version of (X)HTML or XML detected by **HTML Tidy** or as overridden by the user.
    


3. Deliverables
---------------

Deliverables are described in **2.1 Success Criteria**, as our deliverables _are_ our success.

### 3.1 Milestones

Other infrastructure deliverables’ milestone dates are fixed at 2015-Feb-28 for draft status, following a 30 day request for comment and revision period, followed by a vote of HTACG members targeting 2015-March-30.

**HTML Tidy** development milestones shall be stated in its roadmap as required in **2.1 Success Criteria**. 



4. Dependencies and Liaison
---------------------------

None.



5. Relationship to External Groups
----------------------------------

None.



6. Participation
----------------

All participation is voluntary, however developers, users, and implementors of **HTML Tidy** are encouraged to join HTACG such that their voices can be heard and so that they can contribute toward governance.

In the event that the member count of HTACG shall fall below 20 following one quarter of its founding (i.e., after 2015-April-15) then the HTACG members shall considering disbanding the group and transferring control of **HTML Tidy** to another party.



7. Communication
----------------

Following a temporary period after the founding of HTACG during which existing ad-hoc communication schemes will generally be used, HTACG offers three mailing lists which should be used for HTACG and **HTML Tidy** related business.

- [public-htacg](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-htacg/): Should be used for discussion about HTACG as an organization, and is the preferred forum for debate about proposed changes to the **HTML Tidy** API and feature requests. [Our public source code repositories](https://github.com/htacg) offer the ability to post feature requests, and while these should be used to communicate directly with the requestor and for matters not requiring debate, public debate should be moved to this list.

- [public-htacg-contrib](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-htacg-contrib/): Can be used for contributor discussions. [Our public source code repositories](https://github.com/htacg) offer tools for discussing questions pertaining to and the merits of suggested pull requests, and should be preferred. Matters of public debate pertaining to pull requests should be posted to this list.

- [internal-htacg](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/internal-htacg/): should be used for internal, non-public discussions.

- [W3C HTACG Chat](irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#htacg) is our IRC channel.



8. Decision Policy
------------------

This Community Group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. We expect that typically, a contributor makes an initial proposal, which is refined in discussion with Community Group members and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal decision-making. However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but after due consideration of different opinions, consensus is not achieved, the Chair should put a question (allowing for remote, asynchronous participation using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a decision and any objections, and consider the matter resolved, at least until new information becomes available.



9. Patent Policy
----------------
This Community Group operates under the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) (5 February 2004 Version). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.
