Contributor Agreement
=====================

**HTML Tidy** is released under a free and open source license. In order to
ensure that that it is not encumbered by non-free code, we ask contributors to
understand that their contributions are expected to be free and unencumbered.
As such HTACG requires that you understand the following (adopted from the Linux
Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1):

* * *

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right
   to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

2. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my
   knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the
   right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether
   created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license
   (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in
   in the file; or

3. The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
   certified (1), (2) or (3) and I have not modified it.

4.  I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and
    that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I
	submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be
	redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
	involved.

At this time there is no specific sign off requirement. It is expected that you
have a basic knowledge of the project to which you are contributing including
knowledge that a Contributor Agreement exists. Submitting a pull request or
pushing to a repository will be regarded as your acknowledgement of the above.


Contingencies
-------------

In the future should it be necessary all persons with commit access will be
required to post the above certification pushed with their credentials to this
repository, and pull request authors will be required to sign their pull request
posts with the message:
